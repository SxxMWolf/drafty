    <h1>Privacy Policy for Drafty</h1>

    <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>
        Drafty is a browser extension designed to help users improve their writing
        and understand content through AI-powered text rewriting and summarization.
        Your privacy is important to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Drafty processes only the text that a user explicitly selects and submits
        for rewriting or summarization. The extension does not automatically collect
        or monitor webpage content.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        Selected text is used solely to perform the requested AI operation
        (rewriting or summarization). The text is sent securely to our backend server
        for processing and is not stored after the request is completed.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Drafty does not store user-selected text, personal data, browsing history,
        or website content. Only non-personal preference settings (such as selected
        writing tone) may be stored locally using browser storage.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        User-selected text is transmitted only to Drafty’s AI processing server
        for the purpose of providing rewriting and summarization functionality.
        Data is not sold, shared, or used for purposes unrelated to Drafty’s core
        functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
        You control when Drafty processes text. The extension activates only when
        you select text and explicitly choose to use its features.
    </p>
